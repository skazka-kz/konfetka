### About the webapp

You can see the app here: [http://konfetka-shop.kz](http://konfetka-shop.kz) and [http://dev.konfetka-shop.kz](http://dev.konfetka-shop.kz). The current live version is a different "placeholder" app. The dev version is most up to date. Word of warning, the admin panel is not very pretty or UI friendly yet.

The front end of the app was made using Create-React-App, an outstanding starter for react apps. The back-end is powered by NodeJS using the Express web server, MongoDB for the database and Redis for caching.

More info coming in a separate blog post.
